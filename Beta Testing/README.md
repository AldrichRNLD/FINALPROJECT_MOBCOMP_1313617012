## Who are the tester? and why do i think this tester is part of the audience?

The tester in this Beta Testing process is my high school friend Ilhaam Akmal Abdjul. I choose him to be my tester because he is currently having an part time job as a freelance programmer who also coworking with many people remotely from their home. So, with this Dude Tracker app, Akmal can monitor his coworkers locations during work hour to avoid ineffective work process.
